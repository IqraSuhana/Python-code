# In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
# A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
# A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
#both return some method
